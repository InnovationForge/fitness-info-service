# fitness-info-service (FIS)
A fitness API that provides information about workouts, exercises, and nutrition plans for different fitness goals.

## FIS Solution design overview
Developing a fitness info service that provides information about workouts, exercises, and nutrition plans for different fitness goals can be a valuable project. Here's a high-level outline of the steps you can follow to implement the desired features:

* Data Modeling: Design the data models for your application. This might include entities like FitnessGoal, Workout, Exercise, NutritionPlan, and any other related entities you may need. Consider the relationships between these entities.
* Data Storage: Choose a database solution to store your data. Spring Boot supports various databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB. Select the one that suits your needs and configure the data source.
* Fitness Goals: Define different fitness goals, such as weight loss, muscle gain, or strength training. Create endpoints or functionality to manage fitness goals, including adding, editing, and deleting goals.
* Workout Management: Implement functionality for managing workouts. Create endpoints or functionality to add, edit, and delete workouts. Include features like categorizing workouts by muscle group, difficulty level, or duration.
* Exercise Repository: Develop an exercise repository that provides a collection of exercises. Implement functionality to search and retrieve exercises based on criteria like muscle group, equipment needed, or exercise type (cardio, strength, flexibility, etc.).
* Nutrition Plans: Design nutrition plans tailored to different fitness goals. Create endpoints or functionality to manage nutrition plans, including adding, editing, and deleting plans. Consider including features like meal suggestions, calorie tracking, and macronutrient breakdown.
* User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for your fitness info service. You can create a web-based frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. Alternatively, develop a mobile app using frameworks like React Native or Flutter.
* User Management: Implement user registration, login, and authentication functionality. Use Spring Security to handle user authentication and authorization. Include features like user profiles, fitness goal tracking, and personalized recommendations.
* Workout Tracking: Enable users to track their workouts and progress. Implement functionality to log completed workouts, record sets, repetitions, weights, and durations. Provide visualizations or reports to visualize progress over time.
* Nutrition Tracking: Implement features for users to track their nutrition intake. Allow users to log meals, track calories, and monitor macronutrient consumption. Provide insights and recommendations based on users' nutrition goals.
* Testing: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the functionality of your application. You can use tools like JUnit and Mockito for testing in Spring Boot.
* Deployment: Deploy your application to a hosting platform or a cloud provider. You can use services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku for deployment.

Remember to consider user privacy, provide appropriate disclaimers, and consult with professionals or experts to ensure the accuracy and safety of the fitness information provided.

This outline should give you a starting point for developing your Fitness Info Service. Make sure to explore Spring Boot documentation for detailed implementation guidance. Good luck with your project!
